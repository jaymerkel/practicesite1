            Before middle school, I wasn’t interested in writing until my friends and I started creating stories about superheroes. I quickly fell in love with the art form and began co-creating story after story, creating a whole new universe. By the eighth grade, I had completed my first “novel” titled <i>The Super Squad</i>.

            Going into high school, I expanded my hero franchise into other spin-off stories. I also began to write more in the genres of fantasy and sci-fi. Throughout the years, I continued to further develop the universe as both me and my characters grew over the years. As of recently, my project has moved to a developing audio drama. Although this is a completely different medium than written word, I am excited to continue evolving the series I began all those years ago. I hope to use my writing skills to work on the writing team for future audio dramas and/or podcasts.
