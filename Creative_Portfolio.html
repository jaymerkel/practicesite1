        <h3> <i>At the Autumn Festival</i></h3>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Susana stood amongst the midst of the Ball Room, starstruck by its enormousness and beauty. Although she’d seen it many times before, she always loved the way the room seemed to never end. She especially loved the shimmering stained glass windows, which welcomed the last of the warm summer light into the festive hall. 
A person approaching her broke her out of her trance. The woman had a simple yet shining silver dress with a matching sash draped around her arms. Her hair was perfectly braided into a bun, similar to all the other noble women in the at the party. She walked with such grace, Susana had to remind herself to not stare as the woman glided up to her. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        “Hello,” said the new figure. Her voice seemed very calm and kind, which shocked Susana. She was expected to have more of a regal and high class accent by the way she walked and dressed. Though at the same time, everyone was dressed nicely today.
“I don’t believe we met,” she continued as she held out her hand. Susana noticed the glittering ruby on her right ring finger, and again had to try not to stare as she shook her hand. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        “My name is Pearl Oro,” the noblewoman started with a smile. Susana blushed furiously, shaming herself for not recognizing her earlier. The ruby she wore was a gift she had received for her service in social reform, should have been a dead giveaway. If not that, then the charm she wore on her emerald necklace that all congress people wore, should’ve clued her in that she was talking to the highest of society. But per usual, Susana was a step behind in recognizing celebrities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Trying to save herself, Susana performed a very awkward curtsy, “My apologies, my congresswoman..."

        <h3><i>The Emerald Rose Garden</i></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            “You ready Aiden,” I asked him as we stood in the Emerald Courtyard. Along with Aiden, both Will and Maxon stood by me a few meters away from the garnished altar in the center of the clearing. Aiden gave me his usual look of contempt. He looked around and saw that everyone was staring at him. He rolled his eyes as he sulked over to the frozen gemstone. Everyone seemed to hold their breath as he drew near.
Aiden stopped in front of the altar with his eyes fixated on the emerald. As he reached out both hands around the stone, the queen suddenly spoke up, “All you have to do is defrost the Emerald and Nature will be restored.”
Definitely the wrong words to say to Aiden.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He smirked as he dropped his hands back to his side. “You know what?” he said in an irritated tone. He turned on his heels to face the queen, who inturn looked dissatisfied. “I don’t think I’m gonna help you,” he concluded in a dark voice without any expression on his face.
I can’t believe he was doing this. I mean, now of all times. He knows we have to complete this missions or else we won’t be able to continue the Phantom’s Quest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        We all whipped our heads toward Queen Liliana, who narrowed her eyebrows angrily at Aiden. He casually put his hands in his sweatshirt pocket, fully turned away from the still frozen gem. “Why would I help someone who treated me and my friends like crap?” The queen opened her mouth to speak, but he kept talking, “Of course that’s no surprise coming from the queen of this matriarchal jungle world,” the sarcasm in his voice was way more than obvious. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The present ladies-in-waiting near the queen gasped and began to step forward in defense, but Liliana held her hand out to stop them. Instead, she took it upon herself to be defensive, “How dare you insult my nation!” she yelled at Aiden, standing a few meters away, now leaning against the altar. “Have you no respect for royalty?!” she concluded, noting him slouching. 
</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        “Are you really in a position to argue with me?” he responded with an evil grin. The young Queen Liliana held her mouth closed, clearly enraged with Aiden’s usual disrespect. “That’s what I thought,” he continued with a subtle smirk, “I bet you can’t even give me a single reason that could stop me from walking away right now.”
